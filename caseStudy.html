    <h1>Project:MyFlix(Angular Front end)</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this project was to create a front end to use the movie API I created in a previous achievement
        as part of my Full-Stack Immersion Course at CareerFoundry.
        It aimed to pull everything that I had learned together and solve the problem of the myFlix API needing a
        front end to fully function.
    </p>

    <h2>Specifications:</h2>
    <p>
        On this project, I acted as both the front and back end developer. The API was built from scratch by me, as well
        as hosting and maintaining all of the server-side information. The project took about one month to complete.
    </p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <h2>Client-Side</h2>
    <p>
        The process began with organizing much of the basic setup of Angular. Installing different frameworks and
        organizing files in such a way to build the basic steps of the application.

    <p>
        Most of it was in creating different cards and views to allow the user to sign in /
        register / access the information such as movie director and
        genre of movie associated with each film.
    </p>

    <p>
        Much of the setup was involved with creating a basic angular template and then writing new code to facilitate
        each part of the project. The project's stated goals were to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow the user to sign up</li>
        <li>Allow the user to sign in</li>
        <li>Allow the user to see their own profile, with matching information to reflect their sign up data</li>
        <li>Allows the user to view movies from the repository, as well as allowing users to add any of the movies to
            their favorites which can be accessed on their profile</li>
    </ul>
